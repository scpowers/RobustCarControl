# Optimal Planning and Control of a Noisy Car-Like Robot with Obstacle Avoidance
## Final Project for EN.530.678: Nonlinear Control and Planning in Robotics

This project focused on optimal trajectory generation and robust feedback control for a car-like robot. The generalized task is moving between a starting and desired vehicle configuration while avoiding obstacles and exclusion zones.

Note: this project makes use of a differential dynamic programming (DDP) code originally written by Dr. Marin Kobilarov (marin(at)jhu.edu). All credit for the DDP code goes to Dr. Kobilarov.
